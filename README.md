## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Gemini API key (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-health-assistant.git
   cd smart-health-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file and add your Gemini API key
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
   
   Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application

## üéØ How to Use

### 1. Patient Information
- Enter your age, sex, and other relevant details
- List any allergies or current medications
- Provide information about medical history

### 2. Symptom Description
Describe your symptoms in detail. Examples:
- "I've had fever of 101¬∞F and sore throat for 2 days"
- "Headache with sensitivity to light for 3 hours"
- "Cough and chest congestion with mild fever"

### 3. Review Results
The system will provide:
- üìã Preliminary assessment with condition likelihood
- üíä Medication recommendations with Indian pricing
- üè™ Pharmacy availability and delivery options
- üõ°Ô∏è Safety review and risk assessment
- üìä Health insights and preventive care advice

## üîß Configuration

### Gemini AI Integration
The system uses Google's Gemini AI for enhanced symptom understanding and medical assessment. While the system works without it, Gemini integration significantly improves accuracy.

### Medication Database
Edit `data/inventory.csv` to add or modify medication information:
```csv
name,generic_name,strength,brand,form,manufacturer,in_stock,stock_level,price
paracetamol,paracetamol,500mg,Crocin,tablet,GSK,1,High,15
```

### Safety Rules
Modify `core/rules.py` to customize safety checks and validation rules for your specific requirements.
